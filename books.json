    "description": "One might wonder what significance the ancient tales of Shri Hanuman, one of India's most revered deities, hold for people in the world today. However, one needs to read only a few passages from this book to answer this question. His character, courage, selflessness, humility, and dedication to serving God and humankind are precisely what is lacking at this present time.\n\nFor centuries the spiritual luminaries of India have plumbed the depths of the Ramayana to understand Shri Hanuman, Lord Rama's greatest devotee. Paramahamsa Prajnanananda, the author of this book, is among them. A masterful storyteller with wisdom and insight, he unfolds the life and true purpose of Shri Hanuman in a poetic and revealing manner. He offers us a deeper understanding of what a selfless devotee can be. Hence, the reader will ultimately find that Shri Hanuman, the ever-devoted servant of the Lord, is the role model to guide our search for truth."
